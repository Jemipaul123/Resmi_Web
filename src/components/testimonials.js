      text: "I am very grateful to share my experience with Dr. Resmi Sudhir. I reached out to Smita hospital in search of a psychologist and made the right choice by taking an appointment with Dr. Resmi Sudhir. She really helped me to find a solution to my problems and helped me in taking better decisions. She made herself available through online mode when I could not attend offline sessions. Dr. Resmi was very helpful with anything we needed and ensured that we were in safe hands. Thank you, Dr. Resmi, for all the attention, support, and help you provided during the most integral part of my life.",

      text: "Dear Doctor, we wanted to thank you for helping us with our marital issues. Prior to coming to you, we never realized or accepted the fact that our personality differences are the root cause of our problems. During the therapy, we started identifying and accepting our differences. Once again, thank you so much for giving us the tools that will hopefully help us lead a happy married life.",
